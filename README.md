# UFOS
UFOS

## **Overview**
The purpose of this project is to use Javascript to help build Dana's webpage with a dynamic table on UFO sightings. We will be adding filters for our table so users are able to conduct their search on multiple search criteria.

## **Results**
We successfully built the webpage with the aforementioned filters. To illustrate, I conducted a search using the United States as the country and California as the State. We can see that there are other filters as well which we can also utilize to narrow down our search.

### **Summary**
Taking a look at our webpage, one major drawback is that the search function can only return exact matches so partial searches won't generate any results. Everything is also case-sensitive. I would recommend implementing something in Javascript to address user searches and search results.

I took it upon myself to add a clear filters button to make the webpage more interactive as seen in the image above.
